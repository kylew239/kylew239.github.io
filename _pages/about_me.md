I am a current M.S. Robotics student at Northwetsern University. I graduated from Case Western Reserve University in 2023 with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering. My interest in robotics started in high school, when I participated in the FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics Competition. I spent my undergraduate career taking robotics-related courses while participating in CWRU robotics teams. After that, I decided to pursue a Master's degree in Robotics to learn more about the industry and develop my skills. Some of my current robotics interests include swarms, prosthetics, and drones. I am currently seeking summer internships and full-time positions in robotics, and I'm excited to enter the industry and explore robotics projects.

## Prior Robotics Experiences
### CWRU Robotics Team
In the 2022-2023 school year, I became the co-lead for the Combat team. We participated at NRC with the same robot as the previous year (described below), but we also designed a 30-pound in the hopes of competing at UIUC's Robobrawl competition and the National Havoc Robot League competitions. Our design used a front drum-like spinner. The robot chassis was machined out of a single aluminum block to improve structural integrity, and used a rear-wheel-drivetrain with omniwheels in front. In the end, we were unable to finish the robot due to time constraints with finals, machine shop schedules, and limited man-power.

In the 2021-22 school year, I participated in the National Robotics Competition (NRC) Combat team, where we designed a full body spinner robot consisting of a flexible 3D printed chassis with a three omni wheel drivetrain. Our weapon was a beyblade inspired aluminum ring around the robot that was attached to the frame with a polycarbonate wheel on the top. Due to COVID-19 complications, this was the first time this team competed in a few years, and everyone on the team was new. We ended up placing in the top 8 at the NRC Combat Post-secondary Division.

### FIRST Tech Challenge Team 11697
During 9th grade in high school, my friends and I became interested in robotics, and we wanted to explore the field. We had a unique opportunity, since a family friend used to coach a different FIRST robotics team. We reached out, and we ended up founding FTC Team 11697. Throughout highschool, I had the privelage of being a part of this team as it grew. Although we started in the 2016-17 competition season, we quickly improved. 

In the 2017-18 season, we managed to make it to the NJ State Competition. Since then, the team has consistently made it to the State competition.
In the 2018-19 season, we improved significantly and made it to the Worlds competition in Detroit. Although our placement at Worlds wasn't great, it was still a great accomplishment for us, and we learned a lot about robotics and we met many different accomplished teams.

Unfortunately, the 2019-20 season was cut short due to the pandemic. This was also my last year in highschool and on the team. However, I did stay in touch with the team during college, and I acted as a mentor to them.
