This project is focused on machine learning and aims to build a shepherding model based on human behavior. A simulation and data collection environment was built using pygame. Data was collected before being put into the training and evaluation pipeline. This project implements an [Action Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04137){:target="_blank"} machine learning model.

## Shepherding and Diffusion Policy
The 
Diffusion Policy is a machine learning model used for generating robot action sequences based on a dataset of human demonstrations.
